    "The main reason to use PEP8 is for readability purpose. It seeks to achieve a \"pythonic\" code, which is mainly that it follows the idiomatic writing style specific for Python (readability, simplicity, and clarity). The idea of making the code follow an specific guideline, is that once you come back to read a code that you wrote previously, this style will make it easier for the user to understand what the code was written for. \n",
    "\n",
    "While using PEP8 you can be sure that you named the variables in a correct way, you've added enough white space bewteen lines, and mostly you've commented your code well. All of this will mean your code is more readable and easier to come back to. "
